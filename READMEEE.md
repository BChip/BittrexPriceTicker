# BittrexPriceTicker
A price ticker thats snapped to the bottom of your website that will display coins on bittrex that have a volume of 10+ BTC. Also has a built in IRC chat button. So far it uses Curl, HTML, PHP, CSS, and JavaScript


Basically this will stick to the bottom of any page *fixed CSS* and in that fixed bar, it will display coins on Bittrex.com with 10+ BTC volume. There will also be a chat button that will open up a iframe for a IRC client. 

Hope you guys enjoy and help with the project! Thanks!

Lanuages used: PHP, JavaScript, HTML

We used curl to pull the API
The Scrolling is powered by JavaScript
The data is running with php
HTML is for display
CSS is for pretty colors ;p
